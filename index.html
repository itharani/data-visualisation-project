            <h2>How Bad Is It?</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">The map highlights the regional disparities in drug addiction rates across Malaysia. Perak, Perlis, Terengganu, Kelantan, and Pahang stand out as areas with 
              particularly high or moderately high prevalence of drug cases. This suggests that these states face significant challenges in combating drug trafficking and addiction due to potential 
              law enforcement issues and lack of infrastructure to support drug rehabilitation and prevention programs. </p>

            <h2>Female vs Male and How old?</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">The bar graphs show the number of drug addicts in Malaysia, categorized by gender and age group. 
              Males have significantly higher rates of drug addiction than females across all age groups. The 40+ age group has the highest number of drug addicts for both genders. It's evident that the number of drug addicts increases with age. 
              This could be due to factors such as delayed onset of addiction, increased vulnerability and societal changes.</p>

            <h2>The 'Hot' substances?</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">The chart reveals that amphetamine-type stimulants are the most prevalent drug type 
              among the 75,291 cases reported, followed by opiates and cannabis. This suggests that factors such as 
              availability, affordability, and stimulant effects may contribute to their widespread use. Amphetamines, 
              in particular, pose a significant health risk due to their high 
              addiction potential and associated adverse effects.</p>

            <h2>How do they get caught?</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">
              Drug offenses vary significantly by age group and type. Older individuals (35+) 
              are more likely involved in possession and positive urine tests, indicating higher 
              rates of drug consumption, likely due to long-term addiction or dependency. Younger 
              adults (19–35) are also frequently caught with possession or positive urine tests, 
              suggesting recreational use or experimentation. Minors (0–18) show minimal offenses, with equal involvement in supply, 
              possession, and urine tests, indicating early exposure to drug activity.
               These trends suggest a need for targeted interventions: 
              prevention and education for younger adults to prevent escalation, while for older individuals,
               rehabilitation should address both addiction and underlying social issues.

              <h2>Skill Issue?</h2>
              <p  style="text-align: justify;">
                Drug addiction among individuals in both public and private sectors often stems from high workplace 
                stress, inadequate mental health support, and the accessibility of substances. Many employees face 
                significant stress due to demanding workloads, leading them to seek relief through substance use, 
                while the workplace culture in certain industries may normalize this behavior. Economic disparities and 
                stigma surrounding addiction further complicate the issue, as those in lower-income jobs may be more 
                vulnerable due to financial stress and limited access to resources. Without robust policies and support 
                structures, organizations may inadvertently contribute to the cycle of addiction, underscoring the need 
                for comprehensive approaches to foster healthier environments.</p>

            <h2>Does education make a difference?</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">While workplace stress and inadequate support structures significantly 
              contribute to drug addiction, educational attainment plays a crucial role in this issue. Data indicates 
              that individuals with lower levels of education, such as those who have completed only their SPM or PMR, account for over more than 
              two-thirds of addiction cases, followed by those with only primary school education. This trend suggests that a lack 
              of education limits access to better job opportunities, financial stability, and awareness of the risks 
              associated with substance use. Lower educational attainment can hinder understanding of mental health and addiction, 
              leaving individuals ill-equipped to cope with stressors or seek help. Therefore, addressing educational disparities 
              and providing targeted support can be vital in breaking the cycle of addiction, as enhancing educational opportunities 
              and promoting awareness can lead to healthier choices and improved life outcomes for those affected.</p>

            <h2>New vs Relapse Cases</h2>
            <p  style="text-align: justify;">The distinction between new and relapse cases in drug addiction treatment reveals important trends in community-based and institutional approaches. In community-based treatment, out of 65,372 individuals, 44,675 are new cases, indicating approximately 68% are entering treatment for the first time, while in institutional-based treatment, 4,748 out of 9,919 individuals are new cases, representing about 48%. Community-based programs typically emphasize accessibility and holistic approaches, making them more approachable for individuals seeking help, whereas institutional treatment often focuses on medical stabilization in a controlled environment, which may deter individuals from seeking help until their addiction becomes severe. Relapse rates can be high in both settings due to a lack of aftercare or triggering environments upon returning to daily life. Addressing these challenges, such as improving access to ongoing support, can enhance recovery outcomes and reduce relapse rates</p>
